    This function creates an "item group" which may contain one or more
    individual items. The items within a group may be any combination of
    fungible or nonfungible. The distinction between a fungible and a
    nonfungible item is made by checking the item's possible `_maximumSupply`;
    nonfungible items will naturally have a maximum supply of one because they
    are unqiue. Creating an item through this function defines its maximum
    supply. The size of the item group is inferred from the size of the input
    arrays.

    The primary purpose of an item group is to create a collection of
    nonfungible items where each item within the collection is unique but they
    all share some data as a group. The primary example of this is something
    like a series of 100 trading cards where each card is unique with its issue
    number from 1 to 100 but all otherwise reflect the same metadata. In such an
    example, the `_maximumSupply` of each item is one and the size of the group
    would be specified by passing an array with 100 elements in it to this
    function: [ 1, 1, 1, ... 1 ].

    Within an item group, items are 1-indexed with the 0-index of the item group
    supporting lookup of item group metadata. This 0-index metadata includes
    lookup via `maximumSupply` of the full count of items in the group should
    all of the items be minted, lookup via `currentSupply` of the number of
    items circulating from the group as a whole, and lookup via `groupSizes` of
    the number of unique items within the group.

    @param initialSupply An array of per-item initial supplies which should be
                         minted immediately.
    @param _maximumSupply An array of per-item maximum supplies.
    @param recipients An array of addresses which will receive the initial
                      supply minted for each corresponding item.
    @param data Any associated data to use if items are minted this transaction.
