  @title A proxy registry contract.

  @author Tim Clancy

  This contract was originally developed by Project Wyvern
  (https://github.com/ProjectWyvern/) where it currently enjoys great success as
  a component of the primary exchange contract for OpenSea. It has been modified
  to support a more modern version of Solidity with associated best practices.
  The documentation has also been improved to provide more clarity.
