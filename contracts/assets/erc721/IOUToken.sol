  @title A minimalistic, gas-efficient ERC-721 implementation forked from the

  Compared to the original `Super721` implementation that this contract forked
  from, this is a very pared-down contract that includes simple delegated
  minting and transfer locks.

  This contract includes the gas efficiency techniques graciously shared with
  the world in the specific ERC-721 implementation by Chiru Labs that is being
  called "ERC-721A" (https://github.com/chiru-labs/ERC721A). We have validated
  this contract against their test cases.
