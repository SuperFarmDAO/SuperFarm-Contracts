/**
  @title A vault for securely holding tokens.
  @author Tim Clancy

  The purpose of this contract is to hold a single type of ERC-20 token securely
  behind a Compound Timelock governed by a Gnosis MultiSigWallet. Tokens may
  only leave the vault with multisignature permission and after passing through
  a mandatory timelock. The justification for the timelock is such that, if the
  multisignature wallet is ever compromised, the team will have two days to act
  in mitigating the potential damage from the attacker's `sentTokens` call. Such
  mitigation efforts may include calling `panic` from a separate, uncompromised
  and non-timelocked multisignature wallet, or finding some way to issue a new
  token entirely.

    intercede to save the tokens from vault one before the malicious token send
