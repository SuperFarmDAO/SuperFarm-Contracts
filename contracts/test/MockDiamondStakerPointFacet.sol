 * This staking contract disburses tokens from its internal reservoir according

 * It also supports Items staking for boosts on native ERC20 staking rewards.
 * The item staking supports Fungible, Non-Fungible and Semi-Fungible staking.
 * This code is inspired by and modified from Sushi's Master Chef contract.
